# CryptoFlasherV2

CryptoFlasherV2 is a blockchain transaction simulation and visualization platform built for testing, performance analysis, and demonstration within a controlled network environment. It enables users to generate large volumes of customizable BTC transaction activity and observe how transaction flows would behave between addresses modeled after major blockchain platforms such as Coinbase, Binance, and Blockchain.com.

The system operates on a customized Bitcoin-based framework and broadcasts testnet-style transaction data across a dedicated parallel network layer. These transactions can appear temporarily within supported demo interfaces modeled after services like Bybit and LocalBitcoins, allowing users to observe transaction behavior over time. Visibility duration depends on the selected license tier — up to 90 days for the standard license and up to 360 days for the premium license — after which the data is automatically cleared.

With the standard license, users can simulate daily transaction volumes of up to 1,000 BTC and 150,000 USDT. The premium license expands these limits to 15,000 BTC and 860,000 USDT per day. A demonstration video is available upon request.
